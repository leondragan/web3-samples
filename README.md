# Web3 Examples

### :space_invader: Welcome, Solana Developer. :space_invader:   
   
Are you just starting out on Solana? Stuck on something?   
   
Or maybe you're in a hackathon right now, building an absolutely *epic* dApp.   
   
Take a look at this awesome collection of examples in Typescript using Solana's `web3.js` (and Anchor); for your cloning & running pleasure.   
   
### :large_blue_diamond: TypeScript. :large_orange_diamond: JavaScript. :cyclone: Web3. 

## Navigating this Repo

:file_folder: Each example contains two folders:
- `native` - Written using Solana's native `@solana/web3.js` library.
- `anchor` - Written using Anchor's `@project-serum/anchor` library.

:wrench: How to build & run:
- Before running anything in any folder make sure you pull in the dependencies with `yarn install`.
- `native` - `yarn run native`
- `anchor` - `yarn run anchor`
